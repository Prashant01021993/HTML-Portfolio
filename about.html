<H1>About me</H1>
<p> Hello, my name is Prashant Kandari and I am writing to introduce myself. My interests include photography, art, and music. I enjoy making things out of clay and woodworking.</p>

<p>I am a native of the United States and have been here for over 20 years now. I grew up in Delhi where I attended school. After high school, I moved to [state] where I went to college at ABC.</p>
<p>During college, it was not easy for me to make friends because I was shy and quiet. It wasnâ€™t until after college when I started working at [job title], that my relationships with others changed for the better. At work, I was able to open up more as well as learn how to communicate better with others by using body language and tone of voice rather than words alone. This resulted in me being promoted from a part-time employee into an assistant manager position within two years of working there full-time!</p>
